# ShoppingSystem

Notes:
- My application is a console based shopping system

How to launch the Shopping System application
1) Download the application files (https://github.com/curtjpetty5/ShoppingSystem) > Code > "Download ZIP"
2) Unzip the compressed folder "ShoppingSystem-main.zip"
3) From a terminal prompt, navigate to the decompressed application folder
4) Change directories to "bin"
5) Run the application by running the following command, "java -cp bin depaul.edu.MainClass"

The application is pretty self explanatory from there!
